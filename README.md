## 🥃 Two Colors, Four Symbols: Shot Glasses & Drops

To maximize gameplay clarity and honor traditional Solitaire alternating rules, the deck features **two distinct card colors: Black and Green**, with one **Shot Glass** and one **Drop** in each color:

### 🖤 Black Team:
- ♣ **Clubs**: **Black Shot Glass** (Jet-black licorice liquor in a heavy silver/chrome-trimmed glass with specular reflections).
- ♠ **Spades**: **Black Drop** (Dark herbal / licorice liqueur droplet with glossy highlight contour).

### 💚 Green Team:
- ♦ **Diamonds**: **Green Shot Glass** (Vibrant emerald mint Pfeffi in an emerald-trimmed glass with rising carbonation bubbles).
- ♥ **Hearts**: **Green Drop** (Radiant emerald mint schnaps droplet with translucent specular glint).

### 🔄 The Alternating Color Rule (Black ⇄ Green):
In Klondike, tableau cards must alternate in color. In the Schnaps Edition:
- **Black cards (Shot Glass ♣ or Drop ♠)** can only be placed onto **Green cards (Shot Glass ♦ or Drop ♥)**.
- **Green cards (Shot Glass ♦ or Drop ♥)** can only be placed onto **Black cards (Shot Glass ♣ or Drop ♠)**.
- The corner ranks are clearly color-coded (**Black** or **Green**) so you can scan the board at a glance!
- A handy legend is displayed at the bottom of the table felt for quick reference.

## 🎴 Card Design & Face Layout

- **Rank-Only Corners**: Corner indices display **only the rank number or letter** (`A`, `2`–`10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`) in top-left and bottom-right in bold Black or Green.
- **Uniform Pip Sizing (2 to 10)**: All number cards (2 through 10) share the exact same icon dimensions, calibrated to the benchmark size of card 3. Aces (1) feature a prominent showcase symbol in the center.
- **Court / Picture Cards (J, Q, K)**: Rich vector portraits of royal characters holding up their suit's drinking vessel in a celebratory toast, with bottom banners localized to the active language (e.g. BUBE / DAME / KÖNIG in German, JACK / QUEEN / KING in English, etc.):
  - **Jack (J)**: Young dashing squire/knight in a cavalier feathered beret raising the vessel.
  - **Queen (Q)**: Elegant crowned queen with pearls and royal robe gracefully holding the vessel.
  - **King (K)**: Majestic bearded king with a jeweled golden crown raising the vessel in a royal toast.
